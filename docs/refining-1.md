The original plan has been implemented but there is still more to do.

1. First off there are a few lint errors. Please feel free to use `pnpm lint` often while making changes.

```bash
~/cache-control-guru$ pnpm lint

> cache-control-guru@ lint /home/ethan/cache-control-guru
> pnpm run fmt && pnpm run lint:fix

2. Within the app, the Explain feature only shows the result after clicking the Explain Header button. I would rather process the input on every keystroke.
   Everything is synchronous so we may as well.

3. The tab switcher to switch between Explain and Generate is not using https://shadcn-solid.com/docs/components/tabs. We should use that instead of making our own.

4. The generate feature is not implemented. It currently shows "Generator coming soon! For now, try out the Explain mode." We should implement it with
   https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/solid/guides/basic-concepts for state management, shadcn-solid for UI. It should be easier for a user to follow, perhaps with lots of information tooltips. We need to be sure we stick closely with the spec for cache-control. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control

The form should guide the user through the process of crafting a cache control. It might be better to make it kind of like a branching survey. Some of the first few options will invalidate possiblilty of later answers.

I want you to throughly read all of the specifications and articles within `docs/specs/` and update our
form descriptions and explanations accordingly. src/components/generate-form.tsx, src/components/explain-header.tsx, src/lib/cache-control.ts

We should embed as much wisdom from the articles into our form and website as a whole as we can.

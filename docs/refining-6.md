You implemented `docs/refining-5.md` pretty well but this next task is going to be a little more technical.

I believe we should do away with the Explain / Generate split. The entire web page should just have an input at the top and the form options below it

Changing the form options should immiedatly effect the value of the text input at the top of the page. Adding specific directives to the text input (manually typing) should update the form automatically.

Lots of the current code basse relies on Explain / Generate split. We should be able to remove lots oof code:

- src/components/mode-tabs.tsx

- We can simplify `pageSearchParamSchema` (to not include mode) `src/routes/index.tsx`

- We will need to make the `src/components/generate-form.tsx` hold no state, all options will be derived from the text-input value

- We need to do some ui layout changes.

## After you are done, describe a summary of your changes within this file `docs/refining-6.md` below this line

# Changes Made for Unified Interface

## User Interface Redesign

1. Implemented a single unified interface with:
   - Header input field at the top for direct editing of the Cache-Control header
   - Form controls below that sync bidirectionally with the header input
   - Explanation section that updates in real-time based on the header

## Code Structure Improvements

1. Removed redundant components:

   - Deleted `mode-tabs.tsx` (no longer needed for mode switching)
   - Deleted `explain-input.tsx` (integrated into main page)
   - Deleted `header-display.tsx` (integrated into main page)

2. Simplified route parameters:

   - Removed the `mode` parameter from URL search params
   - Consolidated to a single `header` parameter

3. Enhanced the GenerateForm component:

   - Added bidirectional sync between form and header input
   - Implemented `parseHeader()` to update form state from manual text input
   - Added flag to prevent infinite update loops
   - Added smart time unit parsing that converts seconds to appropriate units (days/hours/minutes)

4. Added layout improvements:
   - Header input with examples at the top
   - Copy button for the generated header
   - Two-column layout with form on left, explanations on right

## Technical Features

1. Added a state management layer to avoid infinite loops:

   - Implemented `updatingFromHeader` flag to prevent cycles
   - Form triggers generate only when changed by user, not by header parsing

2. Improved header parsing logic:

   - Added `parseSeconds()` function to convert seconds to appropriate units
   - Added reset logic to clear form state when header is empty

3. Made the form stateless with respect to the URL:
   - All form state is derived from the header parameter
   - Form changes update the URL parameter, which updates the UI

These changes create a more intuitive, cohesive experience where users can either type a header directly or use the form controls, with both approaches kept in sync at all times.

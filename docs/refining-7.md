Also After playing with the website, I don't really think the tooltips are such a good idea. It hides a lot of good information, the user should just be able to read it.

The Copy Header button should be smaller and be on the right side of the input.

Each one of the Configure Options sections should have a desciption that tells the user overall the purpose of that option.

The whole layout of the page is a little weird because there is a lot of skinny text on the left column of the two column layout.

I think that can be improved. It might be useful to combine your thought on this issue with the replacement of the tooltips. It might be better to visually seperate each option a little more.

# Changes Made for UI Improvements and Linting Fixes

## Fixed Linting Errors

1. Fixed type error in time-input.tsx
   - Changed `JSX.Element` to `ReturnType<Component>` to fix the TypeScript error related to redundant type constituents
2. Fixed floating promises issue in index.tsx
   - Added `void` operator to the clipboard API call to handle the promise properly

## UI/UX Improvements

1. Switched to single-column layout

   - Replaced the two-column layout with a sequential design
   - Form controls appear first, followed by the header explanation section
   - Added a visual separator between the sections
   - Made the layout more suitable for future collapsible sections

2. Clear visual separation of descriptions

   - Added a clear visual hierarchy between directive descriptions and usage notes
   - Used different text sizes to distinguish between technical descriptions and usage guidance
   - Added left borders to supplementary information sections
   - Used a consistent pattern across all sections for visual coherence

3. Copy Header Button

   - Moved to the top right of the header input field
   - Made it smaller and more appropriately positioned
   - Changed to "Copy" instead of "Copy Header" for less visual clutter

4. Information Display

   - Better organized explanatory text with clear visual distinction
   - Primary descriptions are larger and more prominent
   - Secondary usage notes are indented and styled as supplementary
   - Preserved the helpful alert boxes for support information

5. Layout for Extensibility
   - Structured the layout to support future collapsible sections
   - Clarified information hierarchy for better scanability
   - Made the content flow more logically from header input to explanation

These changes make the interface more intuitive and informative, with a cleaner single-column flow that's easier to navigate. The clearer visual distinction between different levels of information helps users better understand the options without tooltips hiding important details.
